\chapter{Introduction\label{cha:introduction}}

In the last few years we have seen increased interest in \emph{experimental 
mathematics} where computers are used to perform experiments and analyze data 
in greater quantities than humans are able to process by hand. Combinatorics is 
one field of mathematics that has greatly benefited from the advent of 
computers. Researchers routinely write computer programs that can quickly 
verify or refute hypotheses made by themselves to enable them to more
efficiently allocate their time and energy with regards to the direction of the 
research. 

Even more interesting are computer programs that can act as a source of
inspiration by finding obscure and hidden patterns in large problem spaces. 
This can help the human researcher by giving them the correct idea to further
pursue. One such tool is \Struct\ by \textcite{bean_automatic_2019} which can
automatically discover the structural rules of \emph{permutation 
classes}\footnote{We will define this and other terminology in 
Section~\ref{mesh tilings background}.} and thus conjecture the 
\emph{enumeration} of the set as a function of the length of the 
\emph{permutations} in the set. This is a problem whose solution can be hard to 
discover but easy to prove once found.

Other more complex computer programs exist but they often come with a drawback 
or compromise between usability and effectiveness. \CombSpecSearcher\ by 
\textcite{bean_finding_2018} can find the enumeration of permutation classes, 
along with a proof of its validity, but it required significant work on 
behalf of the researcher in implementing \emph{strategies} specific to the 
domain of permutations. Applying it to another domain would require similar
effort.  

\Struct\ and our extended version \CombCov\ have a lower barrier of entry for 
users in the hope that it will be more widely adopted by researchers. The lack 
of computer generated proofs are mitigated by the fact that the conjectures are 
often easily verified or disproved by the user.

\section{Organization of thesis}

We dedicate Chapter~\ref{words chapter} to explaining how \CombCov\ works from a 
high-level perspective. In Section~\ref{words background} we define \emph{words}
as an intuitive example of \emph{avoidance sets} and in Section~\ref{words 
implementation} we explain how we implement them with \CombCov. In 
Section~\ref{words results} we present some results and analyze the 
effectiveness of \CombCov\ as a tool.

Chapter~\ref{mesh tilings chapter} concerns itself with our main application of 
\CombCov. In Section~\ref{mesh tilings background} we define \emph{permutations}
and \emph{permutation classes}, the domain in which \Struct\ operates, and 
\emph{mesh patterns} and \emph{mesh tilings}. Our implementation of mesh tilings
with  the framework is discussed in Section~\ref{mesh tilings implementation} 
and the results are presented in Section~\ref{mesh tilings results}.

Finally, Chapter~\ref{discussion chapter} concludes the thesis and discusses 
future work on this topic.
