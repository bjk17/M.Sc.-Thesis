	abstract = {We introduce an algorithm that produces conjectures regarding the structure of permutation classes. These conjectures take the form of a disjoint cover of ``rules'', each of which is similar to a generalized grid class. Such a cover is usually easily verified by a human and can often be translated directly into an enumeration. The algorithm is successful in many cases where other algorithms fail and is theoretically guaranteed to succeed on any polynomial permutation class. We apply it to every non-polynomial permutation class avoiding a set of length four patterns. The structures found by the algorithm sometimes allow one to enumerate a permutation class with respect to permutation statistics, and often yield a method for sampling uniformly at random from the class. We additionally sketch a second algorithm formalizing the human verification of the conjectured covers.},

	url = {https://opinvisindi.is/handle/20.500.11815/1184},
	abstract = {New automatic methods for enumerating permutation classes are introduced. The first is Struct, which is an algorithm that conjectures a structural description using rules similar to generalized grid classes. These conjectured structural descriptions can be easily enumerated and are easily verified by a human to be correct.
We then introduce the CombSpecSearcher algorithm, a general framework for searching for combinatorial specifications. To use this, one must write strategies that explain how combinatorial classes are related. We introduce strategies for permutation classes that are used by the CombSpecSearcher algorithm.
We provide an algorithm for finding the insertion encoding of regular insertion encodable permutation classes. Our approach requires less generation of permutations and as such is much faster than previous implementations. The algorithm relies on tilings; a new object introduced that can be used to encode geometric proof ideas for permutation patterns efficiently.
After developing the theory of tilings briefly, we encode more geometric proof ideas that allow for placing points, each such leading to a new algorithm. All of these algorithms search for combinatorial specifications using the CombSpecSearcher which can then be enumerated. The algorithms introduced that use CombSpecSearcher and tilings we collectively call TileScope.custom
We introduce the notion of an elementary permutation class. We show that our definition is equivalent to the permutation class being a disjoint union of generalized peg permutations, and as such all polynomial permutation classes are elementary. We show that such a description for a permutation class can be extended to permutation classes where the basis has an extra pattern.
The methods introduced in this thesis can enumerate all permutation classes with six or more length four patterns. There are only 77 bases consisting of only length four patterns which are not enumerated by our methods.},

We will consider pattern avoidance for such patterns, and give a complete solution for the number of permutations avoiding any single pattern of length three with exactly one adjacent pair of letters. For eight of these 12 patterns the answer is given by the Bell numbers. For the remaining four the answer is given by the Catalan numbers. We also give some results for the number of permutations avoiding two different patterns. These results relate the permutations in question to Motzkin paths, involutions and non-overlapping partitions. Furthermore, we define a new class of set partitions, called monotone partitions, and show that these partitions are in one-to-one correspondence with non-overlapping partitions.},

Two of them, the class of unlabeled (2+2)-free posets and a certain class of involutions (or chord diagrams), already appeared in the literature, but were apparently not known to be equinumerous. We present a direct bijection between them. The third class is a family of permutations defined in terms of a new type of pattern. An attractive property of these patterns is that, like classical patterns, they are closed under the action of the symmetry group of the square. The fourth class is formed by certain integer sequences, called ascent sequences, which have a simple recursive structure and are shown to encode (2+2)-free posets and permutations. Our bijections preserve numerous statistics. We determine the generating function of these classes of objects, thus recovering a non-D-finite series obtained by Zagier for the class of chord diagrams. Finally, we characterize the ascent sequences that correspond to permutations avoiding the barred pattern 31¯524¯ and use this to enumerate those permutations, thereby settling a conjecture of Pudwell.},
